    "text": "Thanks for stopping by!\nI’m a tech professional in the NYC area. I started out working as a software engineer, then later I took on engineering leadership roles. Some of the companies I worked for were small startups where I was one of the first engineering hires.

I don’t like staying idle, I knew I would do something but I decided to take this break without having the slightest idea of what that would be.\nAs the days passed, I thought more and more about my experiences at different companies that I worked for - their differences and similarities. There were similarities in the challenges they faced but huge differences in the actions they took to address them. The actions they took embodied their values. No company gets everything right, but there are companies that through time learn to get most things right. There are others that can’t seem to learn.\nExamining my different professional experiences made me aware of the fact that there is a huge need for better management practices at tech companies, young and old. Tech professionals need to share their experiences and ideas related to management in order to build better tools that encourage best practices.

    "section": "Management is a team game",
    "text": "Management is a team game\nIf you haven’t already read High Output Management - Part I, please do.\n\nManagerial Leverage\nAs I read this book I just kept thinking that High Output Management was first published in 1983. It is amazing how the concepts and guidelines Andy introduced in his book still hold true. Andy  introduced Management By Objectives (MOB) in High Output Management which is used widely across the world and known as planning by Objectives and Key Results (OKRs).\nHere is my summary of part II:\nHow do you measure the output of a manager?\nThis is a critical concept Andy Grove drives home. He defines how a manager’s output should be measured. It is one of the key concepts which the author revisits multiple times.\n\nManager’s Output = The output of their organization + The output of neighboring organization under their influence.\n\nManagers can do their job, their individual work and do it well, but that does not constitute their output. If a manager has a group of people reporting to them or a circle of people influenced by them, the manager’s output must be measured by the output created by their subordinates and associates.  A coach or a quarterback alone does not score touchdowns and win games. Entire teams with their participation, guidance and directions do.\nA manager must keep many balls in the air at the same time and shift their energy and attention to activities that will most increase the output of their organization. In other words,  they should move to the point where their leverage is greatest.\nAcquiring information is an important task for a manager and there are many ways managers gather this information. The more timely the information, the more valuable it is. Most of this information comes via verbal exchanges during one-on-ones with directs or peers, but it also comes from written reports.\nWhy are written reports necessary at all?\nReports also have another totally different function. As they are formulated and written the author is forced to be more precise than they might be verbally. Reports are a medium of self-discipline rather than a way to communicate information.\n\nWriting the report is important; reading it often is not.\n\nI_nformation gathering is the basis of all other managerial work, which is why you should spend substantial amount of your time doing it._\nHow you handle your time is the single most important aspect of being a role model and a leader. Meetings have a bad reputation but, information gathering, information giving, decision making, nudging and being a role model are the activities of a manager and they can’t be performed outside of a meeting.\nHigh Leverage Activities\n\nWhen many people are affected by one manager.\nWhen a person’s activity or behavior over a long period of time is affected by a manager’s brief, well focused set of words or actions.\nWhen a large group’s work is affected by an individual supplying a unique, key piece of knowledge or information.\n\n\nThe art of management is to be able to prioritize high leverage tasks over others.\n\nDelegation\nDelegation without follow through is abdication. You can never wash your hands of a task. Even after you delegate it, you are still responsible for its accomplishment Monitoring a delegated task is the only practical way for you to ensure results.\nIncreasing Managerial Activity Rate:\n\nA manager should use their calendar as a “production” planning tool, taking firm initiative to schedule work that is not time-critical between those “limiting steps” in the day.\nYou should say “no” at the outset to work beyond your capacity to handle.\nYou should allow slack in your calendar.\n\nHow many reports should a manager have?\nA manager whose work is largely supervisory should have six to eight subordinates; three or four are too few and ten are too many.\n\n\nMeetings – The Medium Of Managerial Work\nA big part of a manager’s work is to supply information and know-how, and to impart a sense of the preferred method of handling things to the groups under their control and influence.\nTypes of meetings:\nProcess-Oriented Meetings\nIn process-oriented meetings knowledge is shared, information is exchanged. These meetings take place on a regularly scheduled basis. People attending this meeting should know how the meeting is run, what kinds of topics are discussed and what is to be accomplished. The One-on-One, the staff/Team meeting and the operation review are some of the examples of process oriented meetings.\nOne-On-One: Its main purpose is mutual teaching and exchange of information. A one-on-one should be regarded as the subordinate’s meeting, with its agenda and tone set by them. By talking about specific problems and situations, the manager teaches the subordinate his skills and know-how, and suggests ways to approach problems. At the same time, the subordinate provides the manager with detailed information about what they are doing and what they are concerned about.\nStaff/Team Meeting: A staff meeting is one in which a manager and all of their subordinates  participate, and which therefore presents an opportunity for interaction among peers. Staff meetings create opportunities for the supervisor to learn from the exchange and the confrontation that often develops. What should be discussed in staff meetings? Anything that affects more than two of the people present. The content of the meeting should be mostly controlled, with an agenda issued far enough in advance that the subordinates will have had the chance to prepare their thoughts, but it should also include an open session. What is the role of the manager in the staff meeting? A leader, observer, expediter, questioner, decision maker? The answer is all of them.\nOperation Reviews: This is the medium of interaction for people who don’t otherwise have much opportunity to deal with one another. The basic purpose of an operation review is to keep the teaching and learning going between employees several org levels apart and also increase accountability. The format here should include formal presentations in which managers describe their work to their peers and managers who are not their immediate supervisors.  The review manager is the senior manager at whom the review is aimed. The review manager has a very important although more subtle role to play. They should ask questions, make comments and in general impart the appropriate spirit to the meeting.\nMission-Oriented Meetings\nMission-oriented meeting is usually held ad-hoc and designed to produce specific output, frequently a decision. So, before calling a mission-oriented meeting ask yourself:\n\nWhat am I trying to accomplish?\nIs a meeting necessary or desirable or justifiable?\n\nDon’t call a meeting if all the answers are yes.\nKeep in mind that a meeting called to  make a specific decision is hard to keep moving if more than six or seven people attend. Eight people should be the absolute cutoff. Decision making is a not a spectator sport, because onlookers get in the way of what needs to be done.\n\n\nDecisions, Decisions\n\nThe Ideal Decision Making Process\nFirst stage of an ideal decision making process should be free discussion, in which all points of view and aspect of an issue are openly welcomed and debated. The greater the disagreement and controversy, the more important becomes the word free.\nThe next stage is reaching a clear decision. Again the greater the disagreement about the issue more important becomes the word clear.\nFinally everyone involved must give the decision reached by the group full support. This does not necessary mean agreement: so long as the participants commit to back the decision, that is a satisfactory outcome.\nAnother desirable and important feature of the model is that any decision be worked out and reached lowest most competent level.  This is where decision will be implemented by people are closest to the situation and know most about it.\nIdeally, decision-making should occur in the middle ground, between reliance on technical knowledge on the one hand, and on the bruises one has received from having tried to implement and apply such knowledge on the other.\nIf you either enter the decision-making stage too early or wait too long, you won’t derive the full benefit of open discussion. The criterion to follow is this: don’t push for decision prematurely. Make sure you have heard and considered the real issues rather than the superficial comments that often dominate the early part of a meeting. But if you feel that you have already heard everything, that all sides of the issue have been raised, it is time to push for a consensus.\nOne of manager’s key tasks is to settle six important questions in advance:\n\nWhat decision needs to be made?\nWhen does it have to be made by?\nWho will decide?\nWho will need to be consulted prior to making the decision?\nWho will ratify or veto the decision?\nWho will need to be informed of the decision?\n\n\n\nPlanning: Today’s Actions for Tomorrow’s Output\nYour general planning process should consist of analogous thinking.  Step 1 is to establish projected need or demand. Step 2 is to establish your present status (where will your business be if you do nothing different from what you are doing?) Step 3 is to compare and reconcile steps 1 and 2. What more or less you need to do to produce what your environment will demand.\nManagement By Objectives: The Planning Process Applied to Daily Work\nThe idea behind MBO is extremely simple. If you don’t know where you are going you will not get there.\nSuccessful MBO system needs only to answer two questions:\n\nWhere do I want to go? (The answer provides the objective)\nHow will I pace myself to see if I’m getting there? (The answer gives us milestones, or key results)\n\nTo illustrate an objective and key result, consider the following: I want to go to the airport to catch a plane in an hour. That is my objective. I know that I must drive through towns A, B and C on my way there. My key results become reaching A, B and C in 10, 20 and 30 minutes respectively. If I have been driving for 20 minutes and haven’t yet made to town A, I know I’m lost.\nIf we plan on a yearly basis, the corresponding MBO system’s time frame should be at least as often as quarterly or perhaps event monthly.\nThe one thing an MBO system should provide par excellence is focus. This can only happen if we keep the number of objectives small."

    "text": "High Output Management - Part I\n\n\nHigh Output Management was suggested to me as a good read for managers when I joined Dropbox. The book is written by the late Andy S. Grove who was the former chairman and CEO of Intel. Andy Grove’s thoughts on management in his book High Output Management gave him legendary status in Silicon Valley.\n\n“It has been an honor for me to learn from Andy Grove through the years and I am excited for everyone who is new to High Output Management to join me in this experience.  I know you will enjoy this marvelous book written by the best teacher I have ever know.”  Ben Horowitz, 2015\n\nEven though the book is written with a manager at a tech company in mind, Andy’s suggestions are definitely applicable to other professions and industries. Andy starts by discussing the impact of globalization and new communication tools on organizations and individuals. In summary, globalization and new technologies translates to:\n\nAnything that can be done will be done, if not by you then by someone else.\nEverything happens faster, so managers need to adopt quickly.\n\nThe outcome of globalization and faster dissemination of information creates a less predictable work place. As a manager you need to develop a stronger tolerance for disorder. This does not mean you accept disorder but you as a manager need to be ready mentally and emotionally to bring order to disorder.\n\n“let chaos reign, then rein in chaos” A. Grove\n\n\n\nActivities of a strong manager:\n\nAdd value by continually looking for ways to make things truly better in your department.  \nBe plugged into what is happening inside your company as well as inside your industry as whole.\nTry new ideas, new techniques, and technologies. Don’t just read about them but actually try them.\n\nA manager’s skills and knowledge are only valuable if these skills are used to increase their people’s productivity. It is not about how smart you are or how well you know your business; it is about how your skills and knowledge translate to your team’s performance and output.\nAs a manager all you can do to improve your team’s performance is to motivate them better and train them better.\n\n\nThe Basics of Production\nEven though the author uses serving breakfast consisting of a 3 minute boiled egg, a piece of toast and a hot cup of coffee to teach key concepts of building a production system, he also provides other examples (building a compiler, hiring college graduates, training a sales force) to drive these concepts home.\nThe Limiting step is the step in the production system that takes the longest time. Preparing the egg is the limiting step in the breakfast example. The key idea is to construct a production flow by starting with the longest (or most difficult, most sensitive) step and working your way back.\nWhen recruiting college graduates for your company, the in-house interview is the limiting step because it is the most expensive step in the process (students need to travel to the headquarters, many employees will dedicate hours interviewing the candidates.)\n\n\nFundamental Types Of Production Operations:\n\nProcess -physically or chemically change the material\nAssembly - putting components together to make a new entity\nTesting - examination of characteristics\n\n\nHigh Output Management - Fundamental Types Of Production Operations\nIn summary: Breakfast preparation, college recruiting, and compiler design are very different from one another, but all of them require a similar flow of activity to produce a specific output.\nAdding Value:\nAll production flows have a basic characteristic: material becomes more valuable as it moves through the process. Boiled egg is more valuable than raw, fully assembled breakfast is more valuable than its constituent parts, and finally, breakfast placed in front of a customer is more valuable still. Similarly, a finished compiler is more valuable than the constituent parts of semantic analysis, and code generation.\nWe should always try to detect and fix any problem in a production process at the lowest-value stage possible. For example, if we can decide that we don’t want a college candidate at the time of the campus interview rather than during the course of an on-site visit with the company, we save the cost of the trip and the time of both the candidate and the interviewers.\n\n\nManaging A Production Operation\nTo run the operation well, you will need a set of good indicators, or measurements. The number of possible indicators are limitless, but for any set of them to be useful, you have to focus each indicator on specific operational goals.  Put another way, which five pieces of information would you want to look at each day, immediately upon arriving to your office?\nBecause indicators direct one’s activities, you should guard against overreacting by pairing indicators so that together both effect and counter-effect are measured. Tracking inventory levels and the incidence of inventory shortages would be a good pair. You want to make sure you don’t have more than necessary inventory in stock but you also don’t want to run out of raw material. Measuring the completion date of each milestone in a compiler project and pairing that with the functionality it provides is another good plan.\nA genuinely effective indicator will cover the output of the work unit and not simply the activity involved. You measure a sales person by the orders (output) they get not by the calls they make (activity).\nOther criterion for a good indicator is that what you measure should be a physical, countable thing. These indicators are paired with ones that should stress the quality of work.\n\n\nThe Black Box\nWe can think of the breakfast factory as if it were a “black-box”:\n\nHigh Output Management - The Black Box\nIn general, we can represent any activity that resembles a production process in a simple fashion as a black-box.\nWe can draw a black box to represent college candidate recruiting, where the input is the applicants on campus and the output is college graduates who have accepted employment offers.  The labor is the work of the employees.\n\nHigh Output Management - Examples of Input , Labor and Output\nLeading indicators give you one way to look inside the black box by showing you in advance what the future might look like.\nIn the work of the creative professions, it becomes very difficult to distinguish between output and activity. Stressing output is the key to improving productivity, while looking to increase activity can result in just the opposite.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"

    "text": "First Define Core Responsibilities\n\n\n\nWhat are the expectations for an Engineering Manager?\nEngineering Managers(EMs) do so many things. Let’s start from a high level point of view before diving into tasks that EMs perform on an ad-hoc or recurring basis.\nI believe it really boils down to this: An Engineering manager is accountable for delivering results the business needs through their teams.\nIt is very important to understand that an engineering manager may not be and many times isn’t responsible for carrying out a particular task but he/she is always accountable for the output. No one has as much influence on a team as an EM. No one has as much impact on a team’s output as an EM. As an engineering manager you are expected to assess the situation regularly and ensure that the best results are delivered by your team.\nAndrew Grove said this best:\n\nManager’s Output = The output of their organization + The output of neighboring organizations under their influence.\n\n\n\nEasier said than done…\n\nMake the investments for the long haul\nThere are literally hundreds of things that must be done with care and compassion for an EM to build a team that delivers great results. Going one level down from the description above, EMs are responsible for the following areas for their teams:\n\nHiring great talent\nRetaining and growing the talent they have on their team\nThe reliability of the system their team owns\nCreating roadmaps that are aligned with business needs, executing these roadmaps, sharing and grading the results of the execution\nEvaluating the performance of their directs and communicating results\nAligning with peers across the company to increase the chances of successful results\n\nThis is not a comprehensive list but hopefully it gives some idea of the work an EM needs to perform on an ongoing basis.\nIn my personal experience, the difficulty of these tasks increases drastically as a result of:\n\nA lack of well defined expectations for an engineering manager\nA lack of well defined expectations for engineers\n\nFixing #1 is hopefully not too difficult, one might just agree with what I put down here in this article and be done with it. 😉 ✅\nDefining the expectations for individual contributors is certainly a more complicated and daunting task for many organizations. That said, I think this is exactly where the EM needs to start. Defining the responsibilities of an individual contributor is a pre-requisite for all the work an EM needs to do on an ongoing basis, some of the tasks of which are listed above.\nWhat I’m basically saying is:\n\nHow do you hire a great engineer if you don’t know how to evaluate them against what their core responsibilities will be?\nHow do you do performance evaluation for team members if there is no clarity about what your expectations for them are?\nHow do you ensure your team members are growing if you haven’t defined what they will be responsible for at the next level?\n\nLeaving the core responsibilities of individuals on your team/organization undefined not only makes an EM’s job very difficult but it makes it impossible to be a good EM and build great teams.\n\n\nYou should start with this…\nStart by defining a list of core areas that you expect your team members to be responsible for:\n\nShould they be responsible for the results they are delivering?\nShould they be responsible for helping to hire new engineers?\nShould they be responsible for setting strategic decisions to solve business problems?\nShould they be responsible for helping to create a great environment for their team and others in the company?\n\nThe responsibilities of an individual contributor will clearly increase based on their years of experience. You will need a common language to define these core responsibilities so that you know how to measure a new hire, grow a team member, or determine if someone is on track to deliver great results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"

    "text": "Teams Of Teams\nIf you haven’t already read High Output Management - Part I,  and High Output Management - Part II please do.\n\n\nHybrid Organizations\nThough most are mixed, organizations can come in two extreme forms: in totally mission oriented form or in totally functional form.  \nMission Oriented: In the mission oriented organization which is completely decentralized, each individual business unit pursues what it does – its mission – with little tie-in to other units. Each unit is responsible for determining location, constructing its own building, doing its own merchandising, acquiring and maintaining its own personnel and doing its own purchasing.\n\nMission-Oriented Organization\nFunctional: At the other extreme is the totally functional organization, which is completely centralized. The merchandising department is responsible for merchandising at all locations, the staff of the personnel organization hires, fires and evaluates personnel at all branches; and so on.\n\nHybrid: Intel has a hybrid organization. It has a mix of business divisions, which are mission oriented, and their functional groups. This is much like the way I imagine any army is organized. The business divisions are analogous to individual fighting units, which are provided with blankets, paychecks, aerial surveillance, intelligence and so forth by the functional organization, which supplies such services to all fighting units. Functional groups can be viewed as if they were internal subcontractors.\n\nHybrid Organization - Intel as an example\nOne big advantage with Hybrid organizations is that resources can be shifted and relegated to respond to changes in corporate-side priorities. Intel’s functional groups allow the business units to concentrate on mastering their specific trades rather than having to worry about production and development.\nThis approach also has its disadvantages. The most important is the information overload hitting a functional group when it must respond to the demands made on it by diverse and numerous business units. Even conveying the needs and the demand often becomes difficult – a business unit has to go through a number of management layers to influence decision-making in a functional group.\nThe most important consideration should be this: the shift back and forth between two types of organization can and should be initiated to match the operational styles and aptitudes of the managers running the individual units. The most important task before such an organization is the optimum and timely allocation of its resources and the efficient resolution of conflicts arising over that allocation.\nTo make hybrid organizations work, you need a way to coordinate the mission-oriented units and the function groups so that the resources of the latter are allocated and delivered to meet the needs of the former.\n\n\nModes Of Control\nOur behavior in a work environment (and outside of a work environment) is controlled by three invisible and pervasive means:\n\nFree-market forces (i.e. you buy a particular product from the seller that gives you the best price)\nContractual obligations (i.e. you are obligated to stop at the red light unless you are willing to lose your driver’s license)\nCultural values (i.e. you stop to help people who were in an accident on the freeway)\n\nThere is a temptation to idealize what I’ve called cultural values as a mode of control because it is so “nice”, because everybody presumably cares about the common good. But this is not the most efficient mode of control under all conditions. It is no guide to buying tires, nor could the tax system work this way.\n\nGiven a certain set of conditions, there is always a most appropriate mode of control, which we as managers should find and use.\n\nHow do we do that? There are two variables here: first, the nature of a person’s motivation; and second, the nature of the environment in which the person works. An imaginary composite index can be applied to measure an environment’s Complexity, Uncertainty and Ambiguity which we will call a CUA Factor.\n\nIt is the manager’s job to identify which mode of control is most appropriate\nExamples:\nCindy, the process engineer, is surrounded by tricky technologies, new and not fully operational equipment, and development engineers and production engineers pulling her in opposite directions. Her working environment, in short, is complex.\nBruce, the marketing manager, has asked for permission to hire more people for his grossly understaffed group; his supervisor waffles, and Bruce is left with no idea if he’ll get the go-ahead or what to do if he doesn’t. Bruce’s environment is uncertain.\nMike, Intel transportation supervisor, had to deal with so many committees, councils, and divisional manufacturing managers that he didn’t know which, if any, end was up. He eventually quit, unable to tolerate the ambiguity of his working environment.  \nWhen self-interest is high and CUA factor is low, the most appropriate is the free-market mode.\nAs individual motivation moves  toward group interest, the contractual mode becomes more appropriate.\nWhen group-interest orientation and CUA factor are both high, the cultural values mode becomes the best choice.\nApply this model to a new employee as follows: What is their motivation? It is very much based on self-interest. So you should give them a clearly structured job with low CUA factor. If they do well, they will begin to feel more at home, worry less about themselves, and start to care more about their team. They will get to a point where they can take on more complex, uncertain and ambiguous jobs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"
