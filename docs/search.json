    "text": "Thanks for stopping by!\nI’m a tech professional in the NYC area. I started out working as a software engineer, then later I took on engineering leadership roles. Some of the companies I worked for were small startups where I was one of the first engineering hires. Others were fortune 500 companies with thousands of employees.\nAs you can imagine, my role varied depending on the stage of the company, but overall I was fortunate enough to work with smart people, tackle some difficult technical challenges and grow as a leader.\n\nAt the beginning of 2020 I decided to take a hiatus from work to spend more time with my family and focus more on myself. I don’t like staying idle, I knew I would do something but I decided to take this break without having the slightest idea of what that would be.\nAs the days passed, I thought more and more about my experiences at different companies that I worked for - their differences and similarities. There were similarities in the challenges they faced but huge differences in the actions they took to address them. The actions they took embodied their values. No company gets everything right, but there are companies that through time learn to get most things right. There are others that can’t seem to learn.\nExamining my different professional experiences made me aware of the fact that there is a huge need for better management practices at tech companies, young and old. Tech professionals need to share their experiences and ideas related to management in order to build better tools that encourage best practices. I’m doing my small part here by sharing my own experiences and ideas.\nI hope you find some of this content useful."
