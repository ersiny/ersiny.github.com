    "text": "No wind favors he who has no destined port.  - Montaigne\n\nLet’s continue our conversation about Performance Management and dive more into the goal-setting aspect of the process. If you haven’t read Performance Management yet, you should. It lays some groundwork for this post. I’m using Goals and OKRs interchangeably here but since OKRs provide a more structured and measurable way of setting goals, your quarterly planning should really produce a set of OKRs, not just a few goal statements.\n\nWhat is an OKR?\nOKR stands for Objectives and Key Results. An OKR-based goal has two components: The Objective, which is the goal you want to achieve, and the Key Results which are the metrics and measurable accomplishments that show your progress towards achieving that Objective. Put another way, Key Results are how you will know whether you have succeeded in achieving the Objective or not. Establishing both Objectives and Key Results is helpful because together they make the overall intent and the definition of success explicit.\n\nTo illustrate an objective and a key result, consider the following: I  want to go to the airport to catch a plane in an hour. That is my  objective. I know that I must drive through towns A, B and C on my way  to the airport. My key results become reaching A, B and C in 10, 20 and 30 minutes respectively. If I have been driving for 20 minutes and haven’t yet made it to town A, I know I’m lost.   – Andy Grove\n\n\n\n\n2000m\n\n\nmilestone\n\n\nWhy is setting OKRs so important?\nThere are many ways that a company can set itself above the rest, but in my experience setting, tracking, communicating and grading OKRs plays a critical role in achieving such distinction. This is especially true if such a process is consistently adopted throughout the organization.  \nSome benefits of setting OKRs:\n\nIt pushes the team to accomplish the most important goals and tracks progress towards achieving them.\nIt increases accountability - assuming OKRs are created, tracked and graded regularly.\nIt increases communication across teams, and across the organization.\nIt increases transparency across teams, and across the organization.\n\n\n\nOperational Aspects Of Setting OKRs.\n\nWhen to come up with OKRs\n\nQuarterly is a good interval for setting, grading and communicating OKRs. It usually takes a few meetings for teams to agree on OKRs, plus some time working through a document asynchronously. I would recommend scheduling a few meetings for your team during the last two weeks of the quarter to come up with OKRs.\n\nHow to come up with OKRs\n\nThe company’s objectives, requests from other teams, and reliability/sustainability are some of the factors which influence the setting of objectives for your team. As a manager you are responsible for ensuring that your team considers top down objectives as well as bottom up (objectives that your team thinks are priorities) . Eventually there will be a need to make trade-offs. When that happens it is import for your team to know why you are choosing one objective over another.\nPractically speaking, one good way of coming up with objectives is to meet with your team, ask them what the most important priorities for the team should be, and capture their answers in a doc.\nOnce ideas are gathered, the next step is to have discussions with your team to figure out which objectives are most important to tackle within the next 3 months. Here are some questions to ask during this vetting process;\nWhy is this Objective a priority? Why now?\nWho cares whether this objective is achieved? (Hopefully more than one person)\nWhat happens if you don’t  work on this objective?\nHow big of an effort is this objective? (T-shirt sizing is probably all you need at this point)\nIs this objective achievable? Should it be broken down? Are there external dependencies?\nHow do you measure success?\nEven though having these conversations in person is a great opportunity for the team to get better aligned and feel a stronger sense of ownership , these conversations can certainly be had in a shared doc as well.\n\nWhat is the right number of OKRs for my team?  \n\nHaving a few impactful objectives is much better than having many objectives where the value delivered at the end is not clear.  The number of objectives will certainly depend on the scope  of the objectives as well as the size of the team, but for most teams the number of objectives will be around 3.\n\n\nThings to Keep In Mind\n\nEasy to understand: People outside of your team should be able to read and understand the objective. Focus on communicating the expected output not the activities related to the item.\nGet Feedback: Hopefully your motivation for going through the process of coming up with objectives and key results is to deliver impact and spend your precious time on the most important tasks.  Ask smart people and get their thoughts and suggestions on your goals. This does not necessarily mean you adopt every suggestion, but getting feedback will increase the likelihood of coming up with the right goals, and will also increase transparency and trust.\nOKRs are Tracked: Review your teams progress on their OKRs weekly or bi-weekly and be ready to correct course if needed. Cruise control will not get OKRs to successful completion.\nOKRs are Graded: OKRs should be graded at the end of the quarter as a team. This is a good time for the team to reflect back, and acknowledge the accomplishments as well as the lessons learned.\nResults are Communicated: Sharing the output of your team’s hard work is an important step in the OKR cycle. This action not only keeps people who care about and are impacted by the work your team is delivering in the loop, but it also increases ownership and accountability for your team.  \nNot Carved on Stone: Your team will learn more about the tasks as they make progress on their objectives. Sometimes this will require changing the objective or some of the Key Results. As a manager you should be flexible and ensure timely, proactive communication to stake-holders so the team continues to focus on delivering value to end-users. It should never be about checking off a box.\n\n\n\n\nBlack and White Desk Flat Lay\n\n\nOKR planning, Tracking, Communication Should be On a Schedule\nComing up with OKRs at regular intervals, when combined with regular requests for feedback, and weekly tracking, grading and sharing of results with stakeholders is crucial to making your team successful. Even though coming up with these OKRs may not necessarily be the most pleasant work for you or your team, following a disciplined process will result in many pleasant conversations and communications to the organization about the value your team is delivering. Conversely, the lack of such a disciplined process will result in many unpleasant conversations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"

    "text": "High Output Management Part 4\n\n\n\nNo matter how well a team is put together, no matter how well it is directed, the team will perform only as well as the individuals on it. In other words, everything we’ve considered so far is useless unless the members of your team continually try to do the best work they can do.\n\n\nMotivation & Training\nWhen a person is not doing their job, there can only be two reasons for it. The person is either unable or unmotivated. To determine which one we can employ a simple test: if the person’s life depended on doing the work, could they do it? If the answer is yes the person is not motivated; if the answer is no, they are not capable. If my life depended on playing violin on command, I could not do it.\n\nThe single most important task of a manager is to elicit peak performance from his/her subordinates. He/she can obtain this by giving their employees the training they need and applying different methods of motivation.\n\n\nA manager has two ways to improve performance: Training and motivation\nMotivation has to come within somebody, all a manager can do is to create an environment in which motivated people can flourish.\nMotivation is closely tied to the idea of needs. Simply put, if we are to create and maintain a high degree of motivation, we must keep some needs unsatisfied at all times. Maslow defines a set of needs, as shown below, that tend to lie in a hierarchy; when a lower need is satisfied, a higher one is likely to take over.\n\nMaslow defined a set of needs that tend to lie in a hierarchy: when a lower need is satisfied, a higher one is likely to take over.\nThere are different systems commonly used to motivate. In an MBO (Management By Objective) motivation system, for example, objectives should be set at a point high enough so that even if the individual (or organization) pushes themselves hard, they will still only have a fifty-fifty chance of making them. Achievement driven motivation, such as MBO, is cultivated in an environment that rewards output.\n\n\nMoney and Task Relevant Feedback\nWe now come to the question of how money motivates people. Money is obviously important and necessary. However, once a person perceives that they have more than enough money coming in, they will no longer be motivated by salary increases.\nA simple test can be used to determine where someone is in the motivational hierarchy. If the absolute sum of a raise in salary an individual receives is important to them, they are working mostly within the physiological or safety modes. If, however, what matters to them is how their raise stacks up against what other people got, they are motivated by esteem/recognition or self-actualization. In this case money is still being used as a metric, but it is not the motivating factor.\nThe most effective performance measures in the workplace tie an employee’s performance to the workings of the organization. If performance indicators and milestones in a management-by-objectives system are linked to the  performance of the individual, then the gauge of success for the company will also be a measure of the progress of the individual.\nOur role as managers is first to train the individuals, and second, to bring them to the point where self-actualization motivates them. Once there, their motivation will be self-sustaining and limitless. Self-actualization stems from a personal realization that “What I can be, I must be.” The title of a movie about athletes, Personal Best, captures what self-actualization means: the need to achieve one’s absolute personal best in a chosen field of endeavor.\nAn ideal coach takes no personal credit for the success of their team, and because of that their players trust them. Also, they are tough on their team. By being critical they try to elicit the best performance their team members can provide. Lastly, a good coach was likely a good player themselves at one time, and having played the game well, they also understand it well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"

    "title": "Managing 360 Feedback",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Managing 360 Feedback\n\n\nManagers have quite a lot of information about the performance of their directs. However, even though a manager’s view is an important piece of the puzzle, it certainly does not provide a complete picture of where that individual stands. Managers often rely on feedback from an individual’s teammates and cross-functional partners to come up with a more comprehensive assessment, which can then be used when coaching the individual.\nAs discussed here, collecting 360 feedback is a critical component of the Performance Management Process. Feedback should be collected throughout the year on a weekly  basis. It is powerful for someone to submit their feedback when they see that their colleague has done an excellent job and should be recognized. Avoiding recency bias is another big benefit of collecting feedback continuously, instead of only once or twice a year.\n\n\n\nBalance\n\n\n\nGiving Effective Feedback\nTo ensure that your feedback is effective, it is important to keep the following concepts in mind when either providing or requesting it:\n\nCare personally. You should be writing feedback for someone because you want to help that individual improve in a particular area, or you want to let that person know that they have done an excellent job. The feedback will likely not be well-received if the reviewer does not provide it with good intentions.\nBe specific. If you are acknowledging work well-done, don’t just say, “You did awesome with project X”. Describe the situation, describe what the individual did to move things in the right direction, and explain the individual’s impact. The same thing goes for feedback for improvement. Thinking through the details increases the chances that the feedback will be taken seriously and will be found to be useful. This framework is called SBI (Situation, Behavior and Impact).\nBe Flexible. Be prepared to change your mind. Sometimes we don’t have the complete picture of a given situation.\n\n\nWho do you ask for feedback?\n\nTeammates with whom this person works closely\nCross-functional partners with whom this person works closely\nYourself (the manager)\n\nHow many people should you ask to provide feedback?\nUsually asking 3-5 people to provide feedback should give a manager sufficient insight. If the individual is up for a promotion you should consider asking for feedback from around 6-8 people to ensure you are getting well-balanced and comprehensive feedback. Make sure you get feedback from your senior engineers.\nWhen to share feedback?\nYou should share the feedback with your directs when things are fresh in their minds. There might be some cases when you need to have an ad-hoc conversation as soon as you received the feedback but in most cases it is OK to wait a few days until your next scheduled 1:1.\nManagers should not just rely on their views to get a complete assessment of their team members. They should collect feedback from people with whom the individual works closely. This ensures a manager gets a comprehensive 360 view of the strengths and weaknesses of the individual. To make sure team members are utilizing their strengths and improving their weaknesses, managers need specific feedback focused on individual growth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"

    "text": "High Output Management - Part I\n\n\nHigh Output Management was suggested to me as a good read for managers when I joined Dropbox. The book is written by the late Andy S. Grove who was the former chairman and CEO of Intel. Andy Grove’s thoughts on management in his book High Output Management gave him legendary status in Silicon Valley.\n\n“It has been an honor for me to learn from Andy Grove through the years and I am excited for everyone who is new to High Output Management to join me in this experience.  I know you will enjoy this marvelous book written by the best teacher I have ever know.”  Ben Horowitz, 2015\n\nEven though the book is written with a manager at a tech company in mind, Andy’s suggestions are definitely applicable to other professions and industries. Andy starts by discussing the impact of globalization and new communication tools on organizations and individuals. In summary, globalization and new technologies translates to:\n\nAnything that can be done will be done, if not by you then by someone else.\nEverything happens faster, so managers need to adopt quickly.\n\nThe outcome of globalization and faster dissemination of information creates a less predictable work place. As a manager you need to develop a stronger tolerance for disorder. This does not mean you accept disorder but you as a manager need to be ready mentally and emotionally to bring order to disorder.\n\n“let chaos reign, then rein in chaos” A. Grove\n\n\n\nActivities of a strong manager:\n\nAdd value by continually looking for ways to make things truly better in your department.  \nBe plugged into what is happening inside your company as well as inside your industry as whole.\nTry new ideas, new techniques, and technologies. Don’t just read about them but actually try them.\n\nA manager’s skills and knowledge are only valuable if these skills are used to increase their people’s productivity. It is not about how smart you are or how well you know your business; it is about how your skills and knowledge translate to your team’s performance and output.\nAs a manager all you can do to improve your team’s performance is to motivate them better and train them better.\n\n\nThe Basics of Production\nEven though the author uses serving breakfast consisting of a 3 minute boiled egg, a piece of toast and a hot cup of coffee to teach key concepts of building a production system, he also provides other examples (building a compiler, hiring college graduates, training a sales force) to drive these concepts home.\nThe Limiting step is the step in the production system that takes the longest time. Preparing the egg is the limiting step in the breakfast example. The key idea is to construct a production flow by starting with the longest (or most difficult, most sensitive) step and working your way back.\nWhen recruiting college graduates for your company, the in-house interview is the limiting step because it is the most expensive step in the process (students need to travel to the headquarters, many employees will dedicate hours interviewing the candidates.)\n\n\nFundamental Types Of Production Operations:\n\nProcess -physically or chemically change the material\nAssembly - putting components together to make a new entity\nTesting - examination of characteristics\n\n\nHigh Output Management - Fundamental Types Of Production Operations\nIn summary: Breakfast preparation, college recruiting, and compiler design are very different from one another, but all of them require a similar flow of activity to produce a specific output.\nAdding Value:\nAll production flows have a basic characteristic: material becomes more valuable as it moves through the process. Boiled egg is more valuable than raw, fully assembled breakfast is more valuable than its constituent parts, and finally, breakfast placed in front of a customer is more valuable still. Similarly, a finished compiler is more valuable than the constituent parts of semantic analysis, and code generation.\nWe should always try to detect and fix any problem in a production process at the lowest-value stage possible. For example, if we can decide that we don’t want a college candidate at the time of the campus interview rather than during the course of an on-site visit with the company, we save the cost of the trip and the time of both the candidate and the interviewers.\n\n\nManaging A Production Operation\nTo run the operation well, you will need a set of good indicators, or measurements. The number of possible indicators are limitless, but for any set of them to be useful, you have to focus each indicator on specific operational goals.  Put another way, which five pieces of information would you want to look at each day, immediately upon arriving to your office?\nBecause indicators direct one’s activities, you should guard against overreacting by pairing indicators so that together both effect and counter-effect are measured. Tracking inventory levels and the incidence of inventory shortages would be a good pair. You want to make sure you don’t have more than necessary inventory in stock but you also don’t want to run out of raw material. Measuring the completion date of each milestone in a compiler project and pairing that with the functionality it provides is another good plan.\nA genuinely effective indicator will cover the output of the work unit and not simply the activity involved. You measure a sales person by the orders (output) they get not by the calls they make (activity).\nOther criterion for a good indicator is that what you measure should be a physical, countable thing. These indicators are paired with ones that should stress the quality of work.\n\n\nThe Black Box\nWe can think of the breakfast factory as if it were a “black-box”:\n\nHigh Output Management - The Black Box\nIn general, we can represent any activity that resembles a production process in a simple fashion as a black-box.\nWe can draw a black box to represent college candidate recruiting, where the input is the applicants on campus and the output is college graduates who have accepted employment offers.  The labor is the work of the employees.\n\nHigh Output Management - Examples of Input , Labor and Output\nLeading indicators give you one way to look inside the black box by showing you in advance what the future might look like.\nIn the work of the creative professions, it becomes very difficult to distinguish between output and activity. Stressing output is the key to improving productivity, while looking to increase activity can result in just the opposite.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"

    "text": "Let’s Talk More About Imposter Syndrome\n\n\nImposter syndrome is when a person’s doubts about their abilities lead to persistent fears of being exposed as a fraud. The most accomplished and skilled individuals can be convinced that they don’t deserve what they have achieved.\nPeople with imposter syndrome often feel that they don’t belong. This is sometimes a result of that person not fitting the “norms” in race, gender, or educational background for their field.\nUnfortunately there are many downsides for those who suffer from imposter syndrome:\n\nThey might be self-conscious and as a result they won’t speak their minds and push for solutions they have in mind.\nThey might overwork themselves to achieve even more in order to fight against imposter thoughts. This can lead to an unhealthy work/life balance and burnout.\nDoubting oneself can cause pain and suffering, leading to depression.\n\nI personally experienced imposter syndrome when I was working as a software engineer, but I felt it much more strongly when I stepped into an engineering management role. I felt that I didn’t belong for a few reasons.  English is my second language and I grew up in a culture quite different from that of the US. My educational background also differed from most of my colleagues, who went to Ivy League schools. This difference was glaring because many of the companies I worked for targeted Ivy League schools when hiring engineering talent. I felt out of place knowing that I did not graduate from one of these top private universities. It’s not a good reason to conclude that I’m a fraud. However, even if imposter syndrome is not rational, the suffering is still real.\nImposter syndrome is not a rare occurrence, quite the contrary, it is very common in the tech industry. Hopefully it will not take a lot of effort for me to convince you of this fact given the lack of diversity in the tech industry, especially when it comes to gender and race. Despite all of this,  I think the industry does very little to recognize and help address imposter syndrome. People at tech companies need to be informed about this problem.\nHere are my suggestions for addressing imposter syndrome at work:\n\nEducate employees about imposter syndrome. These thoughts don’t reflect reality, and if they learn more about this topic they can break unhealthy thought patterns.\nFacilitate mentor/mentee relationships for new employees. Everybody needs to connect with somebody at work.\nMake an effort to recognize others’ accomplishments. We all tend to be quite occupied with our own thoughts. If you pay attention to your peers and call out their accomplishments you will notice that this act is beneficial for your peers as well as for you.\nTreat people fairly regardless of their background, race or gender. Hold everyone to the same bar.\n\n\nImposter syndrome is real and felt by many smart, hardworking people every day. I believe talking about imposter syndrome openly with team members, colleagues, and peers is a good way to start addressing it. Having a conversation about it and sharing personal experiences will encourage others to share and hopefully help reduce or eliminate imposter syndrome.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Performance Management 🙀\n\n\nMy experiences with the performance management process at different companies varied drastically, often depending on the company’s size. However, I would argue that the performance management process should be very similar whether your company has 5 employees or thousands.\nIf I were to categorize my experience in broad and non-technical terms 🤠\n\nThere are workplaces where Performance Management just does not happen. You would be lucky if your manager spent more than 5 minutes a year giving you feedback on areas of strengths, areas of improvement, or supporting your career goals.\nThere are places that just wing it.  The performance review process is in place but no one can really describe how it’s structured. The expectations from individuals involved are not clear, therefore the process does not always achieve the goal of accelerating employee growth and impact. In short, the performance review process is only in place perhaps just to say there is one. (I hope this does not come across as too cynical.)\nThere are places where Performance Management is a well-thought-out process for managers and individual contributors. The process is created to help individuals achieve their potential and grow in the company. However, getting it done is a herculean task and dreaded by everyone who is involved in the process. 💪🏼😩\n\n\nWhy is Managing Performance so Important?\n\n\n\nTaking care\n\n\nwhy should we care?\nPeople naturally want to grow in almost every aspect of their lives. At work growth means (well, should mean) the ability to deliver more impactful results.\nThe increase in impact comes when  complex, impactful projects (both technically and/or organizationally complex) are delivered.  The skills that are required to deliver such projects are acquired over time with practice, conscious focus and coaching. Without guidance, feedback and a plan there would be very few individuals would would be able to acquire the skills to deliver these complex projects.\nFor the business,  an individuals’ growth should translate to business growth since these people are able to delivery more impactful results for the company.\nPerformance management is a critical tool  in a Manager’s toolbox which allows managers to ensure individuals on their teams are getting continuous and  actionable feedback to meet what is expected at their current level and the next. Well-defined expectations for people on your team provide you (the manager) with a set of tools to help you guide your team’s growth and impact. Without this conscious effort you would not be able to help people grow to their potential and that would be just sad…\n\n\nHow Can Good Performance Management Go Wrong?\n\nPerformance Management \nFor engineering managers, the performance management process can be anxiety-inducing and exhausting. Some coping mechanisms include:  \n\nGoing away for vacation as soon as performance management is done 🏝🏝 (usually for more than one week)\nTalking about the dreadful experience with fellow managers usually over a 🍷 or 🍷🍷\nComing up with some way to reduce the workload next time around, by doing more work now. 📜\n…\n\nIn all seriousness, we need to ask how we can run a performance management process which will provide team members with feedback on strengths and weaknesses, encourage their growth and move them towards their goals, without losing so much sleep. How can we drastically reduce the overhead required to evaluate your team’s performance?\nHere are some ideas:\n\nInstead of running an annual, bi-annual, or quarterly process which is heavy on everyone involved and ineffective we should run a process which continuously evaluates performance and provides feedback to people.\nInstead of focusing on one rating number or a promotion we should should focus on helping team members gain the skills they need. Promotion decisions can involve looking at snapshot of performance data and deciding whether the individual is ready for the next level at a chosen time.\nAvoid recency bias, and loss of good feedback by collecting timely 360 feedback from reviewers and using them to coach your team when this information is most effective.\n\n\nSet Goals / OKRs\n\nThis should be done at the beginning of each quarter. I recommend setting around 3 goals.\nIn regular circumstances goals should be set by the direct report with the manager’s input.\nGoals are not set in stone. Things change as we learn more about them so goals should be fluid, but always focused on delivering the results that will create a positive impact.\n\nAs discussed here previously, keep in mind your expectations for an individual at his/her level while setting goals.\nCollect 360 Feedback\n\nSome of his/her teammates\nCoworkers with whom this person regularly interacts\nFeedback (Self feedback) from the direct\nManager’s feedback\n\nI sometimes call feedback signals because the word signal indicates continuity. Feedback should be collected throughout the year on a daily/weekly basis. It is powerful for someone to submit feedback when they see that their colleague has done an excellent job in an area that the company values. Avoiding recency bias is another big benefit of collecting feedback continuously instead of only once or twice a year.\nHold Regular Performance Check-ins\n\nFrequent alignment check-ins are crucial. Providing positive or constructive feedback as soon as possible while it’s still fresh is essential. You can decide whether to schedule a separate meeting for this check-in or use part of your weekly 1:1. Either way, both you and your direct report should know when these check-ins will happen so you can both prepare. These check-ins should be lightweight, ongoing conversations that help align expectations and correct course if necessary. They are also an opportunity to share feedback from others and provide coaching.\nThere are a few key ingredients which are needed for a performance management process that is effective at growing team members: Goals, Feedback and Frequent Check-ins.  Making performance management a continuous process and not a once-a-year thing is powerful. It is also important to separate performance management from promotion and compensation conversations which will serve as a distraction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"

    "text": "First Define Core Responsibilities\n\n\n\nWhat are the expectations for an Engineering Manager?\nEngineering Managers(EMs) do so many things. Let’s start from a high level point of view before diving into tasks that EMs perform on an ad-hoc or recurring basis.\nI believe it really boils down to this: An Engineering manager is accountable for delivering results the business needs through their teams.\nIt is very important to understand that an engineering manager may not be and many times isn’t responsible for carrying out a particular task but he/she is always accountable for the output. No one has as much influence on a team as an EM. No one has as much impact on a team’s output as an EM. As an engineering manager you are expected to assess the situation regularly and ensure that the best results are delivered by your team.\nAndrew Grove said this best:\n\nManager’s Output = The output of their organization + The output of neighboring organizations under their influence.\n\n\n\nEasier said than done…\n\nMake the investments for the long haul\nThere are literally hundreds of things that must be done with care and compassion for an EM to build a team that delivers great results. Going one level down from the description above, EMs are responsible for the following areas for their teams:\n\nHiring great talent\nRetaining and growing the talent they have on their team\nThe reliability of the system their team owns\nCreating roadmaps that are aligned with business needs, executing these roadmaps, sharing and grading the results of the execution\nEvaluating the performance of their directs and communicating results\nAligning with peers across the company to increase the chances of successful results\n\nThis is not a comprehensive list but hopefully it gives some idea of the work an EM needs to perform on an ongoing basis.\nIn my personal experience, the difficulty of these tasks increases drastically as a result of:\n\nA lack of well defined expectations for an engineering manager\nA lack of well defined expectations for engineers\n\nFixing #1 is hopefully not too difficult, one might just agree with what I put down here in this article and be done with it. 😉 ✅\nDefining the expectations for individual contributors is certainly a more complicated and daunting task for many organizations. That said, I think this is exactly where the EM needs to start. Defining the responsibilities of an individual contributor is a pre-requisite for all the work an EM needs to do on an ongoing basis, some of the tasks of which are listed above.\nWhat I’m basically saying is:\n\nHow do you hire a great engineer if you don’t know how to evaluate them against what their core responsibilities will be?\nHow do you do performance evaluation for team members if there is no clarity about what your expectations for them are?\nHow do you ensure your team members are growing if you haven’t defined what they will be responsible for at the next level?\n\nLeaving the core responsibilities of individuals on your team/organization undefined not only makes an EM’s job very difficult but it makes it impossible to be a good EM and build great teams.\n\n\nYou should start with this…\nStart by defining a list of core areas that you expect your team members to be responsible for:\n\nShould they be responsible for the results they are delivering?\nShould they be responsible for helping to hire new engineers?\nShould they be responsible for setting strategic decisions to solve business problems?\nShould they be responsible for helping to create a great environment for their team and others in the company?\n\nThe responsibilities of an individual contributor will clearly increase based on their years of experience. You will need a common language to define these core responsibilities so that you know how to measure a new hire, grow a team member, or determine if someone is on track to deliver great results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"

    "text": "Performance Check-In Conversations\n\n\nAfter setting quarterly OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) and  picking  reviewers who will provide 360 feedback, scheduling a monthly Check-In Conversation will complete the last but very important step for creating a powerful Performance Management Process.  A Performance Management Process should focus on increasing your team’s output and impact as well as growing their careers.\nMonthly performance check-in conversations may sound like too much of a time commitment, but their benefits will far outweigh the 40 minutes dedicated to them monthly.\n\n\n\nteach me senpai\n\n\n\nThe Focus Of Check-In Conversations\nThe goal of these regular conversations is to ensure that your team members are performing at their grade. You do this by giving both you and your direct the chance to pause and reflect on their progress in different areas of their core responsibilities. Having these conversations monthly promotes strong alignment of goals and the ability to correct course as necessary.\nAs a manager you need to keep in mind that you are going to have these check-ins monthly. Limit the number of messages you want to convey to your direct. Focus on the few most critical topics and ensure they are followed up on.\nThe Monthly Check-In conversation is not a weekly 1:1 meeting. It is important for you to make sure that your direct understands the context for these check-in conversations and comes prepared. Here are some of the things both you and your direct need to be prepared to discuss:\n\nCome prepared to review and grade their performance in each area of their core responsibilities. Are you concerned about the progress or direction of any of the OKRs? Agree on related action items.\nCome prepared to share 360 feedback with your direct and agree on follow up action items.  I highly suggest compiling this feedback in SBI (Situation, Behavior and Impact) format before communicating.\nCheck-in conversations focus on longer term (quarterly, annual) goals. You and your direct should come prepared to discuss potential long term projects aligned with your direct’s career growth.\n\n\n\n\nThe main things to keep in mind for check-in conversations:\n\nBe explicit about the goals of your check-in meetings. They are not another weekly 1:1.\nMake sure to align yourselves on quarterly goals and expectations. Both you and your direct share opinions on progress made toward goals. Disagreements should be surfaced way before deadlines.\nLeave with action-items to follow up on. Action items should be tracked.\n\nMonthly check-ins don’t need to be too formal or burdensome. You should take advantage of light-weight check-ins to correct course, share feedback, and help your direct achieve their goals.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Teams Of Teams\nIf you haven’t already read High Output Management - Part I,  and High Output Management - Part II please do.\n\n\nHybrid Organizations\nThough most are mixed, organizations can come in two extreme forms: in totally mission oriented form or in totally functional form.  \nMission Oriented: In the mission oriented organization which is completely decentralized, each individual business unit pursues what it does – its mission – with little tie-in to other units. Each unit is responsible for determining location, constructing its own building, doing its own merchandising, acquiring and maintaining its own personnel and doing its own purchasing.\n\nMission-Oriented Organization\nFunctional: At the other extreme is the totally functional organization, which is completely centralized. The merchandising department is responsible for merchandising at all locations, the staff of the personnel organization hires, fires and evaluates personnel at all branches; and so on.\n\nHybrid: Intel has a hybrid organization. It has a mix of business divisions, which are mission oriented, and their functional groups. This is much like the way I imagine any army is organized. The business divisions are analogous to individual fighting units, which are provided with blankets, paychecks, aerial surveillance, intelligence and so forth by the functional organization, which supplies such services to all fighting units. Functional groups can be viewed as if they were internal subcontractors.\n\nHybrid Organization - Intel as an example\nOne big advantage with Hybrid organizations is that resources can be shifted and relegated to respond to changes in corporate-side priorities. Intel’s functional groups allow the business units to concentrate on mastering their specific trades rather than having to worry about production and development.\nThis approach also has its disadvantages. The most important is the information overload hitting a functional group when it must respond to the demands made on it by diverse and numerous business units. Even conveying the needs and the demand often becomes difficult – a business unit has to go through a number of management layers to influence decision-making in a functional group.\nThe most important consideration should be this: the shift back and forth between two types of organization can and should be initiated to match the operational styles and aptitudes of the managers running the individual units. The most important task before such an organization is the optimum and timely allocation of its resources and the efficient resolution of conflicts arising over that allocation.\nTo make hybrid organizations work, you need a way to coordinate the mission-oriented units and the function groups so that the resources of the latter are allocated and delivered to meet the needs of the former.\n\n\nModes Of Control\nOur behavior in a work environment (and outside of a work environment) is controlled by three invisible and pervasive means:\n\nFree-market forces (i.e. you buy a particular product from the seller that gives you the best price)\nContractual obligations (i.e. you are obligated to stop at the red light unless you are willing to lose your driver’s license)\nCultural values (i.e. you stop to help people who were in an accident on the freeway)\n\nThere is a temptation to idealize what I’ve called cultural values as a mode of control because it is so “nice”, because everybody presumably cares about the common good. But this is not the most efficient mode of control under all conditions. It is no guide to buying tires, nor could the tax system work this way.\n\nGiven a certain set of conditions, there is always a most appropriate mode of control, which we as managers should find and use.\n\nHow do we do that? There are two variables here: first, the nature of a person’s motivation; and second, the nature of the environment in which the person works. An imaginary composite index can be applied to measure an environment’s Complexity, Uncertainty and Ambiguity which we will call a CUA Factor.\n\nIt is the manager’s job to identify which mode of control is most appropriate\nExamples:\nCindy, the process engineer, is surrounded by tricky technologies, new and not fully operational equipment, and development engineers and production engineers pulling her in opposite directions. Her working environment, in short, is complex.\nBruce, the marketing manager, has asked for permission to hire more people for his grossly understaffed group; his supervisor waffles, and Bruce is left with no idea if he’ll get the go-ahead or what to do if he doesn’t. Bruce’s environment is uncertain.\nMike, Intel transportation supervisor, had to deal with so many committees, councils, and divisional manufacturing managers that he didn’t know which, if any, end was up. He eventually quit, unable to tolerate the ambiguity of his working environment.  \nWhen self-interest is high and CUA factor is low, the most appropriate is the free-market mode.\nAs individual motivation moves  toward group interest, the contractual mode becomes more appropriate.\nWhen group-interest orientation and CUA factor are both high, the cultural values mode becomes the best choice.\nApply this model to a new employee as follows: What is their motivation? It is very much based on self-interest. So you should give them a clearly structured job with low CUA factor. If they do well, they will begin to feel more at home, worry less about themselves, and start to care more about their team. They will get to a point where they can take on more complex, uncertain and ambiguous jobs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"

    "text": "Management is a team game\nIf you haven’t already read High Output Management - Part I, please do.\n\nManagerial Leverage\nAs I read this book I just kept thinking that High Output Management was first published in 1983. It is amazing how the concepts and guidelines Andy introduced in his book still hold true. Andy  introduced Management By Objectives (MOB) in High Output Management which is used widely across the world and known as planning by Objectives and Key Results (OKRs).\nHere is my summary of part II:\nHow do you measure the output of a manager?\nThis is a critical concept Andy Grove drives home. He defines how a manager’s output should be measured. It is one of the key concepts which the author revisits multiple times.\n\nManager’s Output = The output of their organization + The output of neighboring organization under their influence.\n\nManagers can do their job, their individual work and do it well, but that does not constitute their output. If a manager has a group of people reporting to them or a circle of people influenced by them, the manager’s output must be measured by the output created by their subordinates and associates.  A coach or a quarterback alone does not score touchdowns and win games. Entire teams with their participation, guidance and directions do.\nA manager must keep many balls in the air at the same time and shift their energy and attention to activities that will most increase the output of their organization. In other words,  they should move to the point where their leverage is greatest.\nAcquiring information is an important task for a manager and there are many ways managers gather this information. The more timely the information, the more valuable it is. Most of this information comes via verbal exchanges during one-on-ones with directs or peers, but it also comes from written reports.\nWhy are written reports necessary at all?\nReports also have another totally different function. As they are formulated and written the author is forced to be more precise than they might be verbally. Reports are a medium of self-discipline rather than a way to communicate information.\n\nWriting the report is important; reading it often is not.\n\nI_nformation gathering is the basis of all other managerial work, which is why you should spend substantial amount of your time doing it._\nHow you handle your time is the single most important aspect of being a role model and a leader. Meetings have a bad reputation but, information gathering, information giving, decision making, nudging and being a role model are the activities of a manager and they can’t be performed outside of a meeting.\nHigh Leverage Activities\n\nWhen many people are affected by one manager.\nWhen a person’s activity or behavior over a long period of time is affected by a manager’s brief, well focused set of words or actions.\nWhen a large group’s work is affected by an individual supplying a unique, key piece of knowledge or information.\n\n\nThe art of management is to be able to prioritize high leverage tasks over others.\n\nDelegation\nDelegation without follow through is abdication. You can never wash your hands of a task. Even after you delegate it, you are still responsible for its accomplishment Monitoring a delegated task is the only practical way for you to ensure results.\nIncreasing Managerial Activity Rate:\n\nA manager should use their calendar as a “production” planning tool, taking firm initiative to schedule work that is not time-critical between those “limiting steps” in the day.\nYou should say “no” at the outset to work beyond your capacity to handle.\nYou should allow slack in your calendar.\n\nHow many reports should a manager have?\nA manager whose work is largely supervisory should have six to eight subordinates; three or four are too few and ten are too many.\n\n\nMeetings – The Medium Of Managerial Work\nA big part of a manager’s work is to supply information and know-how, and to impart a sense of the preferred method of handling things to the groups under their control and influence.\nTypes of meetings:\nProcess-Oriented Meetings\nIn process-oriented meetings knowledge is shared, information is exchanged. These meetings take place on a regularly scheduled basis. People attending this meeting should know how the meeting is run, what kinds of topics are discussed and what is to be accomplished. The One-on-One, the staff/Team meeting and the operation review are some of the examples of process oriented meetings.\nOne-On-One: Its main purpose is mutual teaching and exchange of information. A one-on-one should be regarded as the subordinate’s meeting, with its agenda and tone set by them. By talking about specific problems and situations, the manager teaches the subordinate his skills and know-how, and suggests ways to approach problems. At the same time, the subordinate provides the manager with detailed information about what they are doing and what they are concerned about.\nStaff/Team Meeting: A staff meeting is one in which a manager and all of their subordinates  participate, and which therefore presents an opportunity for interaction among peers. Staff meetings create opportunities for the supervisor to learn from the exchange and the confrontation that often develops. What should be discussed in staff meetings? Anything that affects more than two of the people present. The content of the meeting should be mostly controlled, with an agenda issued far enough in advance that the subordinates will have had the chance to prepare their thoughts, but it should also include an open session. What is the role of the manager in the staff meeting? A leader, observer, expediter, questioner, decision maker? The answer is all of them.\nOperation Reviews: This is the medium of interaction for people who don’t otherwise have much opportunity to deal with one another. The basic purpose of an operation review is to keep the teaching and learning going between employees several org levels apart and also increase accountability. The format here should include formal presentations in which managers describe their work to their peers and managers who are not their immediate supervisors.  The review manager is the senior manager at whom the review is aimed. The review manager has a very important although more subtle role to play. They should ask questions, make comments and in general impart the appropriate spirit to the meeting.\nMission-Oriented Meetings\nMission-oriented meeting is usually held ad-hoc and designed to produce specific output, frequently a decision. So, before calling a mission-oriented meeting ask yourself:\n\nWhat am I trying to accomplish?\nIs a meeting necessary or desirable or justifiable?\n\nDon’t call a meeting if all the answers are yes.\nKeep in mind that a meeting called to  make a specific decision is hard to keep moving if more than six or seven people attend. Eight people should be the absolute cutoff. Decision making is a not a spectator sport, because onlookers get in the way of what needs to be done.\n\n\nDecisions, Decisions\n\nThe Ideal Decision Making Process\nFirst stage of an ideal decision making process should be free discussion, in which all points of view and aspect of an issue are openly welcomed and debated. The greater the disagreement and controversy, the more important becomes the word free.\nThe next stage is reaching a clear decision. Again the greater the disagreement about the issue more important becomes the word clear.\nFinally everyone involved must give the decision reached by the group full support. This does not necessary mean agreement: so long as the participants commit to back the decision, that is a satisfactory outcome.\nAnother desirable and important feature of the model is that any decision be worked out and reached lowest most competent level.  This is where decision will be implemented by people are closest to the situation and know most about it.\nIdeally, decision-making should occur in the middle ground, between reliance on technical knowledge on the one hand, and on the bruises one has received from having tried to implement and apply such knowledge on the other.\nIf you either enter the decision-making stage too early or wait too long, you won’t derive the full benefit of open discussion. The criterion to follow is this: don’t push for decision prematurely. Make sure you have heard and considered the real issues rather than the superficial comments that often dominate the early part of a meeting. But if you feel that you have already heard everything, that all sides of the issue have been raised, it is time to push for a consensus.\nOne of manager’s key tasks is to settle six important questions in advance:\n\nWhat decision needs to be made?\nWhen does it have to be made by?\nWho will decide?\nWho will need to be consulted prior to making the decision?\nWho will ratify or veto the decision?\nWho will need to be informed of the decision?\n\n\n\nPlanning: Today’s Actions for Tomorrow’s Output\nYour general planning process should consist of analogous thinking.  Step 1 is to establish projected need or demand. Step 2 is to establish your present status (where will your business be if you do nothing different from what you are doing?) Step 3 is to compare and reconcile steps 1 and 2. What more or less you need to do to produce what your environment will demand.\nManagement By Objectives: The Planning Process Applied to Daily Work\nThe idea behind MBO is extremely simple. If you don’t know where you are going you will not get there.\nSuccessful MBO system needs only to answer two questions:\n\nWhere do I want to go? (The answer provides the objective)\nHow will I pace myself to see if I’m getting there? (The answer gives us milestones, or key results)\n\nTo illustrate an objective and key result, consider the following: I want to go to the airport to catch a plane in an hour. That is my objective. I know that I must drive through towns A, B and C on my way there. My key results become reaching A, B and C in 10, 20 and 30 minutes respectively. If I have been driving for 20 minutes and haven’t yet made to town A, I know I’m lost.\nIf we plan on a yearly basis, the corresponding MBO system’s time frame should be at least as often as quarterly or perhaps event monthly.\nThe one thing an MBO system should provide par excellence is focus. This can only happen if we keep the number of objectives small."
